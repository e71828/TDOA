% This is a helper function and may be removed or modified in a future
% release.

% This function formulates TDOAs from TOA detections given known
% assignments. assignments is a N-by-P matrix, where each row defines the
% assignment between TOA detections. This assignment input can be
% calculated by the staticDetectionFuser as its second output.
